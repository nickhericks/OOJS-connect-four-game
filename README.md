## Project objective
<!-- To complete this project I built customized conditional behavior and interactivity. Form validation is handled on the client side using JavaScript and regular expressions, with customized error messages for each field. Also, jQuery is used in this project which allowed for a shorter and simplified syntax. -->

## Techniques and concepts:
<!-- - jQuery - For document traversal/manipulation, event handling and animation
- Regular Expressions - For form validation
- Progressive Enhancement - JavaScript added without making the page dependent upon JavaScript. -->

## Additional features
<!-- In addition to completing the basic requirements for this techdegree project, I also added additional features including:

- [x] Added functionality allowing players to use physical keyboard (instead of just the on-screen keyboard)
- [x] Personalized CSS styling -->


## Code example
<!-- An example of one of the JavaScript functions in this project:
1. The validEmail function  uses a regular expression to test the value of the email field and assigns the result to an emailIsValid variable
2. A switch statement is then used to determine if an error message is shown or hidden.
3. The emailIsValid variable is then returned and later used along with other form field validation functions to determine if the user can submit the form.

```javascript
// Check email value, show appropriate errors and return true if no errors
const validEmail = function() {
  const emailIsValid = /^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[a-z]+$/i.test($($email).val());
  // If name is valid, hide errors, else show errors
  emailIsValid ? (removeError($($email), $emailError)) : (showError($($email), $emailError));
  // Return true if valid
  return emailIsValid;
}
``` -->
